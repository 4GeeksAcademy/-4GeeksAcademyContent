You are probably here because you are about to start building your final project, how exciting!

> If you are still not clear about [why the final project is so important](https://4geeks.com/lesson/why-build-a-final-project), we recommend you to read this other article.

To better help you choose, you should know that your final project is an effort that integrates and utilizes all the skills and knowledge that have been taught during the course. 🍒 The cherry on top of the 🍰 cake at the end of the bootcamp.
The capstone project is a simulation of a real-life project, probably your experience in developing it will be similar to your work within a company in the future.

Before telling you about the project requirements, we consider it more important to let you know how to avoid failure and ensure that you deliver on time.

## Reasons that make a Full-Stack project fail?

### Not adding too many features

The most common mistake of a student is to think that the quality of your final project is determined by the number of functionalities it has. Nothing could be more false, it is the opposite!!! The more features you have, the worse the quality of your project will be. All great products have only a few features.

- What does Netflix do? It's a billion dollar project where you can find a movie and play it.
- What does uber do? You order a cab.
- What does instagram do? It has a wall with all the posts of the people you follow.

What are you going to do? Pick just one thing you want to do well, then you'll realize it's going to take a lot of work to fulfill that functionality 100%. Remember that after all, the most basic project should already have authentication, integration with third party API, signup, login, etc.

### Don't do another social network

To impress an employer it is best to do novel projects, don't be scared off, if it is possible to do novel projects that have a relatively low level of technical difficulty.

Nowadays there are too many APIs, packages and tools that make your job easier. For example:

- You can connect to the Etherium network and build your own blockchain currency or launch an NFT in a few hours.
- You can send and receive SMS in Python with 20 lines of code.
- You can use a QR code reader in a couple of hours.
- You can program a drone to fly as your code says in a few hours.
- You can use a Raspberry PI with very little effort and have access to temperature sensors, magnetic field, etc.

You should get a lot of feedback from your mentors to make sure you choose a project that is novel, but that you can do.

## General requirements for capstone projects

Depending on the program you are taking you will find different requirements, but, in general, all capstone projects must:

- **Be deployed online**: Either, heroku.com, render.com, Vercel, Azure, AWS, etc. You must make your project available online under some URL and provide a link so you can include it on your resume as a sample of your work.

- **Be done in groups of 2 to 3 (recommended) people**: If you work alone you will fail to learn how to work collaboratively, which is one of the most important requirements of companies. Nor will many of the best practices be necessary. In short, your experience will not be similar to real life.

> 🔥 It is important to work on convincing your teammates to join your project, after all projects are group projects and not all ideas are going to be realized, all members must compromise on some ideas to achieve the best for the team.

- Be uploaded to 4Geeks.com**: When you enter your cohort dashboard, you will find a section to upload your final project information.

- Be presented at a GeekTalk**: The final presentation is a necessary step, it will allow you to have a video of your project, it will also force you to set a deadline and work under pressure. Sometimes we invite potential employers to the GeekTalk who are looking for talent to hire.
