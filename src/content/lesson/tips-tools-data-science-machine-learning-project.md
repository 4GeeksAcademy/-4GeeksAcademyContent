## Why build a data science and machine learning project to get a first job?

There are several reasons why building a data science and machine learning project can be beneficial for landing your first job in this field:

### Demonstrates Skills and Knowledge

- **Practical Application:** It showcases your ability to take theoretical concepts learned in coursework and apply them to a real-world problem. This is much more impressive to employers than just theoretical knowledge.

- **Technical Skills:** The project allows you to develop and showcase your technical skills in areas like data wrangling, model building, and evaluation. Also employers will be able to see your proficiency in specific tools and programming languages like Python or R.

### Portfolio Piece

- **Tangible Accomplishment:** A project provides a concrete accomplishment you can highlight on your resume and during interviews. It gives you something to talk about and demonstrates your initiative and problem-solving abilities.

- **Customization:** You can tailor the project to align with your specific interests within data science or machine learning, showcasing your passion for a particular area.

### Learning Experience

- **Hands-on Learning:** The process of building a project allows you to learn by doing. You'll encounter challenges and have to troubleshoot them, improving your overall understanding of the field.

- **Experimentation:** Projects provide a safe space to experiment with different techniques and approaches. You can test your ideas and learn from your mistakes before applying them in a professional environment.

### Problem-Solving and Communication Skills

- **Project Management:** Building a project requires planning, organization, and time management skills. You'll need to define the scope, gather data, track progress, and meet deadlines.

- **Storytelling:** When presenting your project, you'll need to explain your approach, results, and insights in a clear and concise way. This hones your communication skills and ability to translate technical concepts for a non-technical audience.

Overall, building a data science and machine learning project gives you a well-rounded advantage in the job market. It demonstrates your skills, knowledge, and initiative, making you a more attractive candidate for entry-level data science positions.

## Reasons for a Data Science and Machine Learning Project to Fail

### The Dataset you choose

When choosing a dataset for a data science project, it is important to consider the following factors:

- The size and complexity of the dataset
- The topic of the dataset
- The quality of the data
- The availability of documentation for the dataset.

You can also ask our mentors for datasets that are well-known and can help you.

It's also highly recommended to have data from a company you work for, any company that is willing to provide you with data, or data of the field you may want to work on, like climate research for instance. This would be very beneficial for your profile, as you would have a real-life dataset and a real-life prediction case on your resume.

### Overfitting or Underfitting

Feature engineering is one of the most challenging practices. Before choosing a dataset, discuss with your teacher and teammates the challenges it may bring.

### Processing Capacity

Since we are in an educational environment, your processing resources will be limited. If you choose large datasets, you will have to wait for hours and even days before getting any useful results. This will happen repeatedly. We recommend validating the size of your dataset and other possible processing considerations with your mentors.

## General requirements

- The most important thing is to choose the dataset. What data do you have?
- To impress in data science, it's good to implement predictions in areas like health (e.g., detecting pneumonia) or finance (e.g., fraud detection, delinquency, etc.).
- You should make predictions with real-life data.
- Perform a descriptive analysis and showcase your findings
- Build and deploy an API (or even better a website) that can interact with your model to make it useful for other people interested or employers that may want to validate your work

## Where to find a good Dataset to work with?

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions and collaboration. It also has a large collection of public datasets that can be used for data science projects.

- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/): This website is a great resource for finding public domain datasets that can be used for a variety of data science projects. The datasets are well-documented and include a variety of topics, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis.

- [FiveThirtyEight Datasets](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/): FiveThirtyEight is a website that focuses on data-driven journalism. The datasets on FiveThirtyEight are often related to current events and politics.

- [Google Public Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) is a tool that can be used to search for public datasets on the web. The tool allows you to search by keyword, topic, and format. This is a great resource for finding datasets on a wide variety of topics.

- [The World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/): provides access to a wide variety of data about development indicators, demographics, and economics. This data can be used for analyzing poverty trends or predicting economic growth.

- [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/): is a great resource for data about the United States population. The data includes demographics, economics, and social characteristics. This data can be used for analyzing population trends or predicting housing prices.

- [ESA Open Data](https://climate.esa.int/en/data/#/dashboard): provides access to data from the European Space Agency (ESA). The data includes satellite imagery, Earth observation data, and space mission data. This data can be used for analyzing climate change or monitoring deforestation.

- [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/): provides access to a wide variety of environmental data. The data includes climate data, weather data, and oceanographic data. This data can be used for analyzing climate change or predicting weather patterns.
