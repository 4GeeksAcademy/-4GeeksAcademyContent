## Wireframes and web application structure

Wireframes or website skeletons are simplified visual representations of the structure and functionality of a website or mobile application. They are used in the early stages of the design and development process to define the general layout of the user interface and the placement of key elements.They are usually black and white or gray sketches that do not include graphic details such as colors, typography or images. This is because the main purpose of a wireframe is to focus on structure and functionality, not aesthetics.

### What elements do wireframes usually include?

- Header: The header usually contains the website logo, the main navigation and other important elements, such as the search bar.

- Main body: The main body is where the main content of the page is displayed. This can include text, images, videos and other interactive elements.

- Footer: The footer usually contains contact information, copyright and other important links.

- Common components: These are elements of recurring use in the application, such as a widget, card, or any other element that appears in various places in your web application.

## What are the benefits of using wireframes?

- Better communication: Wireframes help improve communication between designers, developers and clients. By having a visual representation of the user interface, everyone involved in the project can be on the same page and avoid misunderstandings.

- Early detection of problems: Wireframes can help detect design and functionality issues early in the development process. This can save time and money in the long run.

- Greater flexibility: Wireframes are easy to change and modify, allowing designers and developers to test different ideas and find the best solution for the project.

- Focus on content: By not including graphical details, wireframes help designers and developers focus on the content of the website and how it will be presented to users.

### Tools for the creation of wireframes and website mockups

There are different tools and methods for creating wireframes. Some designers prefer to use pencil and paper, while others prefer to use specialized software tools. Some popular wireframing tools include:

## Web Application Design Considerations

Now that we have the schematic vision of our web application, it's time to style and functionality. Many of the aesthetic decisions that are made when designing a website, also correspond to functional aspects aimed at improving the user experience. Some of the most important things to take into account are:

### 1. Visual hierarchy

It is important to use visual hierarchy to guide the user's attention to the most important elements of the page. This can be achieved by using different techniques, such as contrast, size, placement and color.
For example, the title of a page should be larger and darker than the body text, and action buttons should be a bold color that contrasts with the background.

### 2. White Space

White space is as important as the elements themselves. Proper use of white space can help a web page look cleaner, more organized and less overwhelming.
Avoid filling every available space with content. Leave space between elements to allow them to breathe and to make the page easier to read.

### 3. Color

Color is a powerful tool that can be used to create emotions, establish brand identity and guide user behavior.
Choose a color palette that is consistent with your company's brand and pleasing to the eye. Use color to highlight important elements and create calls to action.

### 4. Typography

Typography is another important element that can affect the look and feel of a web application. Choose a font that is easy to read and aligns with your company's branding.
Use different font sizes and weights to create visual hierarchy and differentiate between different types of content.

### 5. Images and videos

Images and videos can add visual interest to a web application and make it more appealing to users.
Use high quality images and videos that are relevant to the content of your page. Optimize images so that they load quickly and do not affect website performance.

### 6. Responsive design

It's important to make sure your web application is responsive and looks good on all devices, including desktops, tablets and cell phones.
This means using fluid and flexible designs that will adapt to different screen sizes.

### 7. Accessibility

It is important that your web application is accessible to all users, including people with disabilities.
Follow web accessibility guidelines to ensure that your website is easy to use for people with vision, hearing or mobility impairments.

### 8. User Testing

It is important to test your web application with real users to get feedback and make sure it is easy to use and navigate.
Observe users as they interact with your website and ask them about their experiences. Use their feedback to improve the design of your web application. You can show your application to family or friends and evaluate what their experience with the application is like, see what aspects they find most difficult to understand and use that to improve your design.
